### Marketing Artisan Chocolate Products

### The Brief

Chocolaterie RenMar produces artisan chocolate products using Belgian couverture chocolate and locally sourced ingredients.

It sells its products at farmers markets as well as online, on a third party e-commerce platform - Farmhouse Direct.

The producer needed a website to promote its products and services as well as to house an online retail and wholesale store.

### The Solution

Thesis theme was used together with a skin designed to accomodate an e-commerce online store. It was customised using CSS to create a unique, clean look and feel.

Wordpress plugins were used to provide site optimisation, security and backups. In addition, several Woocommerce plugins were installed to facilitate user-level shop functionality, such as customised product lists for user categories and custom shipping classes.

### Main Features

* Skin customisation
* CSS customisation
* Image editing, colours, typography
* Responsive design
* Google Analytics
* Woocommerce installation and customisation
* Site optimisation and SEO
