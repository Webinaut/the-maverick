        Hi. I'm Martin. Iâ€™m the owner at One Stop Sites as well as a freelance
        Web Developer. I have been developing, supporting and managing websites
        for over 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my development career in 2012 building WordPress authority
        sites, doing SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Social Media
        Marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I build, deploy and manage many Wordpress websites, as well as
        some Astro websites, such as this one. Where the website content is not
        required to be frequently updated, Astro sites offer the best
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        One Stop Sites offers a one stop service for all your website needs.
